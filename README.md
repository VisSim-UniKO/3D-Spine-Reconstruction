# 3D Lumbar Spine Reconstruction
The LumbarSpineReconstruction module registrates a set of artificial sawbone models to custom spine models (L1-L5).
The goal is to align sawbones with the provided vertebra models, which consist of only the vertebral bodies.
In the registration process, the position, orientation and size of the sawbones are adjusted to match the custom spine.
